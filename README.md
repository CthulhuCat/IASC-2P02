### Bio
![](images/CthulhuStars-Span.jpg)

Currently entering my fourth and final year in Interactive Arts and Sciences at Brock University my focus has always been on ludonarrative construction -- how the design of an interactive work can support or change its message and experience. The idea is to always look at the whole of a construct and how its many parts affect the final form. By extension I'd want to expand into studying the further impact interactive works have on the user and how they then affect society; again focusing on the whole but extending its reach. The goal is to follow the chain of interpretation and influence from design all the way up to culture.

My current works demonstrate attention to structure as well as content, an application of my focus. In the analytical assignments which make up the bulk of university I tend to adopt a very critical angle. This critical focus doesn't limit itself to the content or arguements but also takes apart the language and structure of the piece itself. In university this criticism is usually limited to the work itself and does not, or cannot, include the larger impacts of the texts. So, admittedly, they are not excellent examples of my wholistic approach.

My goal is to push research involving interactive works to look deeper and further so, while still acknowledging the common interests and subjects in their study, analysis can move away from focusing on only a fraction of the whole of any particular work.

## Collaborative Project
A brief investigation of the data analysis tool Palladio.

**Project Description**
Done with Aaron Coomber, Kevin Pendergast and Ellen Thornton (three fellow students in the Winter 2017 course Solving Problems Through Interactive Arts & Science) this project required the creation of a presentation about the chosen data analysis tool. Palladio was chosen because of its focus on piecing together patterns from diverse or incomplete data. Using the tool we created a simple demonstration of how to link people using different pieces of personal information such as death, birth, subject or location and how the different mapping tools Palladio had available allowed different interpretations or patterns to emerge. Overall we found that the tool was useful for what it was intended, historical mapping and analysis, and as a presentation aid.

**Collaboration Statement**
The group's approach was to look over the Palladio tool, discuss what we each observed and how it was relevant to fulfilling the assignment, divide the required information into parts and finally have each member choose one of the parts to contribute to the final slideshow and presentation. I prefer to approach collaborative work in much the same way: have each person involved contribute according to their area of knowledge. Making this work definitely requires communication both to ensure nothing is left out or forgotten and so that every collaborator can understand how their own work fits into the whole. My own contribution, the analysis and application of theory to the tool and its use, was chosen because I knew I could do the job. It was important to communicate with the others so that I had their observations and experience with the tool to build the analysis off of. The use of Google Drive helped everyone to communicate and put their contributions directly into the slideshow; as I wasn't feeling well I made sure to leave extensive notes for my slide so that the others could still present that section.

Collaboration works well with my own philosophy regarding the digital humanities. Because I try to focus on understanding the whole of a work it's very helpful to be able to see each person's knowledge and where it connects with the others. As the digital humanities themselves are cross-disciplinary and created from very different skillsets learning to collaborate on a project is very important. Such collaboration also allows me to learn from other contributors and expand my own knowledge and expertise.
