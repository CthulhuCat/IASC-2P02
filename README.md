### Bio
![](images/CthulhuStars-Span.jpg)

Currently entering his fourth and final year in Interactive Arts and Sciences at Brock University Jeremy's focus has always been on ludonarrative construction -- how the design of an interactive work can support or change its message and experience. His goal is always to looki at the whole of a construct and how its many parts affect the final form. By extension he would want to expand into studies of the further impact interactive works have on the user and how they then affect society; again focusing on the whole but extending its reach. The goal is to follow the chain of interpretation and influence from design all the way up to culture.

Jeremy's current works demonstrate attention to structure as well as content, an application of his focus. In the analytical assignments which make up the bulk of university Jeremy tends towards a very critical voice. This critical focus doesn't limit itself to the content or arguements but also takes apart the language and structure of the piece itself. In many cases this criticism is limited to the work itself and does not, or cannot, include the larger impacts of the texts and so also limit the application of his preferred wholistic approach.

Jeremy's goal is to push research involving interactive works to look deeper and further so, while still acknowledging the common interests and subjects in their study, analysis can move away from focusing on only a fraction of the whole of any particular work.
