### Bio

![](CthulhuStars-Span.jpg)

I am a student, gamer, streamer and (currently for school) producer working with all things gaming-related. I have a particular interest in how the whole of a design or how the mechanics, art, narrative, characterisation, controls, GUI and every damned aspect of an interactive work support or sabotage one another.
